{misunderstanding rate} (number of wrong answers => If it's a number, it should not be called a "rate". Is this really the name we should be using?

The part about the binomial generalized logistic regression includes no numbers. It does include a figure, but there is no explanation about the figure. I don't know how to explain it. 

The repeated measures and latin square studies should be called "experiments", not surveys. I'll have to review this in the entire results section.
