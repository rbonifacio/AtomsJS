Between:

It is important to reduce variance within each condition because that cannot be explained. Subjects should be as similar as possible to reduce that source of variance.

Within:

Greater statistical power. Better able to detect an effect, given that one exists. There is less variance between the groups (because a person differs less from her/himself than from another person).


Testing effect (the subject learns!), fatigue effects. 



We cannot use the same test (Chi-square) for both experiments. McNemar is for dependent samples, Chi-square is for independent samples. The Chi-square tests assumes that the groups are not related (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3900058/). This is not the case in the repeated measures study. 


Same treatments, different setting: Replicability is not Reproducibility: Nor is it Good Science
We can corroborate! 


The focus in reproduction is on concepts rather than artifacts —
we try to recreate the essence of the experiment rather than the experiment itself




Within subjects

Advantages and Disadvantages of Within Subjects Experimental Design.
Advantages.
It requires fewer participants than the between subjects design. If a between subjects design were used for the blood pressure example above, double the amount of participants would be required. Within subjects design therefore requires fewer resources and is generally cheaper.
Individual difference between participants are controlled for, as each participant acts as their own control. As the subjects are measured multiple times, this better enables the researcher to hone in on individual differences so that they can be removed from the analysis.

Disadvantages.
Effects from one test could carry over to the next, a phenomenon called the “range effect.” In the blood pressure example, if participants were asked to watch the scary movie first, their blood pressure could stay elevated for hours afterwards, skewing the results from the romantic comedy.
Participants can exhibit “practice effects”, where they improve scores simply by taking the same test multiple times. This is often an issue on pre-test/post-test studies.
Data is not completely independent, which may effect running hypothesis tests, like ANOVA.


Between subjects

Advantages and Disadvantages of Between Subjects Design.
Advantages.
Between subjects design is one of the simplest types of experimental design setup. Other advantages include:

Multiple treatments and treatment levels can be tested at the same time.
This type of design can be completed quickly.
Disadvantages.
A major disadvantage in this type of experimental design is that as each participant is only being tested once, the addition of a new treatment requires the formation of another group. The design can become extremely complex if more than a few treatments are being tested. Other disadvantages include:

Differences in individuals (i.e. age, race, sex) may skew results and are almost impossible to control for in this experimental design.
Bias can be an issue unless you control for this factor using experimental blinds (either a single blind experiment--where the participant doesn’t know if they are getting a treatment or placebo--or a double blind, where neither the participant nor the researcher know).
Generalization issues means that you may not be able to extrapolate your results to a wider audience.
Environmental bias can be a problem with between subjects design. For example, let’s say you were giving one group of college students a standardized test at 8 a.m. and a second group the test at noon. Students who took the 8 a.m. test may perform poorly simply because they weren’t awake yet.

Advantages

Avoid carryover effects
Carryover effects between conditions can threaten the internal validity of a study. A carryover effect is an effect of being tested in one condition on participants' behavior in later conditions.

For example, exposure to a reaction time test could make participants’ reactions times faster in a subsequent treatment if the same subjects were participating in both conditions.

However, in between-subjects study designs, the participants are divided into different treatment groups, so one participants’ exposure to a treatment will not affect the outcome of a subsequent condition.


Short and straightforward
Each participant is only assigned to one treatment group, so the experiments tend to be uncomplicated. Scheduling the testing groups is simple, and researchers tend to be able to receive and analyze the data quickly.

Limitations

Large participant pool is necessary
Because each subject is assigned to only one condition, this type of design requires a large sample. Thus, these studies also require more resources and budgeting to recruit participants and administer the experiments.


Individual differences
Differences between subjects within a given condition may be an explanation for results, introducing error and making the effects of an experimental condition less accurate.
